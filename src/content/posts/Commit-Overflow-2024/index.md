# Welcome to my Commit Overflow 2024 Log!
Commit Overflow is a [Purdue Hackers](https://purduehackers.com) event that is held yearly over the Winter Recess at Purdue University.

The format of this post will be a daily update log of my work, similar to what is being submitted to my Commit Overflow thread.

#### Day 1, Streak 1
While looking for inspiration to start Commit Overflow, I was going to take a look at my website. However, I was interrupted by a little icon on my GitHub homepage. Turns out, GitHub Copilot Free was announced a mere six hours before I began working.

This annoyed me, as I don't like Copilot much, so my project for the day became the creation of a Firefox Add-on that blocks certain Copilot related requests on `https://github.com` and `https://github.githubassets.com`, as well as removed some elements from the DOM related to Copilot.

#### Day 2, Streak 2
##### Mini Commit
Picking up from the previous day, Github Copilot Blocker received Chromium browser support. This was basically plug-and-play as the code is quite simple to begin with. All that needed to be done was packaging a .crx and updating the Readme.

##### Main Commit
My personal website [shad.moe](https://www.shad.moe) has been in disrepair for awhile now, to the point of the entire site being a 404 for much of my recent memory.

Today marks the fourth revival attempt in "[Website But Again The Sequel To The Trilogy](https://git.shad.moe/TheShadowEevee/WebsiteButAgainTheSequelToTheTrilogy)". Today's commit is the creation of a base layout in Astro with Shad/CN. A sidebar with filler information and a site theme was setup and repository was initialized. Vercel was used to stand the site up on my domain.
