# About

Hello! I'm Lumi (@TheShadowEevee). I'm a cybersec/virtual reality/technology enthusiast with a
general interest in many technology-oriented topics and a passion for learning other areas as they
intrigue me.

I am at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu) studying
[Cybersecurity](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/cybersecurity) and
[Computing Infrastructure and Network Engineering Technology](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/computing-infrastructure-and-network-engineering-technology),
with minors in Forensic Sciences and Law and Society. While I primarily work in these areas, I don't
let that restrict my skills; I continue to learn more across many fields, letting new experiences
and projects guide my learning outside class.

If you ever want to get in touch with me, feel free! I can be reached on
[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/theshadoweevee.konpeki.solutions) or via email at
[theshadoweevee@shad.moe](mailto:theshadoweevee@shad.moe) OR
[theshadoweevee@konpeki.solutions](mailto:theshadoweevee@konpeki.solutions).

## What's up with the post URLs?

If you've looked at the address bar while reading one of my posts, you may have noticed a random
jumble of letters and numbers. This is actually a unique ID for the post!

Each of my posts is hosted on the AT Protocol. I talked about this in my post
[Welcome to the ATmosphere](https://shad.moe/posts/3lgbnigwdzk2r/) in more detail. The quick TL;DR
is that posts are stored very similarly to a post on [Bluesky](https://bsky.social), using the
[WhiteWind](https://whtwnd.com) Schema.
